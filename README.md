# Polynomial-List-Sort
### This program lets the user choose a file with polynomials, creates a list of polynomials with the inputs from the file, and checks if they are sorted according to the weak and/or strong order.
The program reads the values written in Polynomials.txt, each line is an expression and the exponent is written after the number, and displays them in the output. The list is then sort by the strongest expression to the weakest.
